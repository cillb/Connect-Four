# Connect Four

This is a connect four game played in the command line. There are two player classes imported to the game file, name Player 1 and Player 2.

A simple board representation is printed out, and instead of the traditional red and yellow tokens, the player numbers are used like so:

          1   2   3   4   5   6   7
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        |   |   |   | 2 | 1 |   |   |
        |   |   | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
        -----------------------------

Each player is prompted to input a number, and the input is checked for validity and availability.

A winning player or a draw is checked for and printed out as well.
